## Description
Chilco was made to limit the time my little sister can play and browse the web on her computer. It stops the time how long processes run and kills them when their time is up. How long a process can run can be changed using the ChilcoSettingsEditor.
### Features
- Counting down time for processes in groups (i. e. using the same timer for every browser)
- Saving up time over multiple days
- Setting a maximum to the time that can be saved
- differentiating between different days of the week
- GUI to change settings
